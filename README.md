# GSynth
Software for gravity field functionals and Earth tides effects

GSynth has been developed by Thomas since 2013. The initial version included the two main components/modules (GRAVsynth and GRAVtide) that have been now merged into one package.

GRAVsynth: Spherical harmonic synthesis of gravity field models for computing gravity anomalies and geoid heights 

GRAVtide: Solid Earth and Ocean Tides effects modelling 

The software has been mostly used in gravity data analysis and tides modelling.
