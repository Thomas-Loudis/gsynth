## GSynth: Software for gravity field functionals and Earth tides effects


GSynth is a software for computing gravity field functionals (gravity anomalies, geoid heights) and Earth tides effects considering solid Earth tides and Ocean tides. 
GSynth has been developed by Thomas since 2013. The initial version included two main modules, GRAVsynth and GRAVtide, that have been now merged into one code package.

GRAVsynth: Spherical harmonic synthesis of gravity field models for computing gravity anomalies and geoid heights 

GRAVtide: Solid Earth and Ocean Tides effects modelling 

The software is being used in gravity data analysis and tides modelling.
